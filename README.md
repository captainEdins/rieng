## Key Features

To improve the user experience and reduce data usage, the app implements the following features:

- **Offline data caching:** Weather data is cached for 5 hours after it's retrieved,
  allowing users to interact with the app even without an internet connection.
  This saves users data by displaying the most recent data available.
- **Refresh option:** Users can manually refresh the data by clicking the arrow next
  to their address, ensuring they have the latest information whenever they need it.
- **Limited Hourly Forecast:** Only displays upcoming hours for the weather forecast.

### Benefits:

- **Reduced data consumption:** By caching data, users can avoid unnecessary data downloads,
  especially beneficial for those with limited data plans.
- **Improved user experience:** Offline data access allows users to view weather information
  even when offline.
- **Cost savings:** Reduced API calls lead to lower subscription costs for the app.
- **Reduced Scrolling:** Saves users time by focusing on relevant weather information for the coming hours.
